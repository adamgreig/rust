# `x86_64-unknown-dragonfly`

**Tier: 3**

DragonFly belongs to the same class of operating systems as
other BSD-derived systems and Linux. It is based on the same
UNIX ideals and APIs and shares ancestor code with other BSD
operating systems. DragonFly provides an opportunity for the
BSD base to grow in an entirely different direction from the
one taken in the FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD series.
